The goal of scalade is to ease the process of loading a whole bunch of related libraries. This is done by organizing packages into "ladders", where each rung can be thought of as an individual package. For any given project, there are a host of packages to load, and it isn't all too rare to see the list of libraries become longer than the script itself. Thus, this is just one way lightweight way of addressing the ever-growing list of libraries you'll be using for any given script/project.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("robertamezquita/scalade")
```

## Usage

### What are Ladders?

Ladders are the term used herein for collections of packages organized under some identifier, e.g. "my_analysis_pkgs" is associated with "dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2"...etc.

### Setup

First, we need to setup the scalade framework:

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
## library(scalade)
scalade::setup_ladders()
```

This will create the necessary `~/.Rscalade` file that will hold the ladder definitions. The scalade package already includes some prebuilt ladders that are used to create the basis of the ladder definition file, `~/.Rscalade`. This file will store your ladders so you can load them in future sessions easily.

Note that you don't have to keep the `.Rscalade` file in your home directory (`~`), you can make it for a specific project too - all the `*_ladder()` functions support a `.scalade = <file>` argument to specify where you want to place the ladder definitions:

```{r setup2, eval=FALSE}
scalade::setup_ladders(.scalade = "my-project.Rscalade")
```

### The Ladder Definitions

The format of `~/.Rscalade` is tidy, as shown in the predefined ladders provided as part of the package below:

```{r example}
scalade:::scalade_prebuilt_ladders[1:5, ]
```

The three key aspects here are the `id` (some meaningful name for the ladder e.g. family of packages), the source `repo` (one of CRAN, Bioconductor, or Remote (for Github)), and the package name itself under `package`.

To view what is already available in our `~/.Rscalade` definition, we can call upon a pretty printing method to show us what our ladders are, what repo they're from, and if we already have the package installed or not and if so what version we have:

```{r view}
scalade::inspect_ladders('bioc_sc_methods')
```

### Installing & Upgrading Ladders

Thus we see have a ladder called `bioc_sc_methods` (single-cell methods from Bioconductor). We have most of the packages already (indicated by the checkmark), but there may be cases where we don't have all of them. In case of any missing packages (marked by an X), or even if we just want to upgrade our ladder, we can install/upgrade via:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
scalade::transport_ladder('bioc_sc_methods')
```

### Creating (and Destroying) Ladders

This can be thought of as "transporting" the ladder from some store (repository) to your home.

Now, let's say we want to create a new ladder definition. We can do that either by directly interactively editing the ladder file via `scalade::edit_ladders()` or by creating new entries via:

```{r new}
scalade::build_ladder(id = 'my_favorites', repo = 'CRAN', packages = c('dplyr', 'tidyr', 'purrr'))
```

Great! But maybe later we will have new favorite packages and want to clean up our ladder collection - in that case we can destroy existing ladders:

```{r burn}
scalade::burn_ladder('my_favorites', overwrite = TRUE)
```

To prevent any accidents, setting the `overwrite = TRUE` argument is required.

### Attaching Ladders

Finally, we come to the best part: actually using our ladders! We can attach our ladders to our project (e.g. load all the packages for a given set of ladders) via:

```{r attach,eval=FALSE}
scalade::climb_ladder('tidypkgs')
scalade::climb_ladder('viz_static', 'networks')
```
```{r attachsmall}
scalade::climb_ladder('pretty_prompt')
```

Thus, for your projects, in lieu of library you can call upon the `climb_ladder()` function to load your family of functions all at once. 

### Portability

To make the project portable the ladder definition file would also have to be shared. To make this easier without having to overwrite a friend's `~/.Rscalade`, you can create such ladder definition files in an ad-hoc manner; all the `*_ladder()` functions support arbitrary `.Rscalade` style files via the `.scalade = <file.Rscalade>` option, e.g.:

```{r attach2, eval=FALSE}
scalade::climb_ladder('my_project_pkgs', .scalade = here::here('project_v1.Rscalade'))
```

## Contributions

Always welcome, please feel free to add ladders (see `R/aaa.R`) and make PRs to enhance the package.

## Inspiration

This was *heavily* lifted from the [tidyverse meta package](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse). I found that I was using this package as a template for other `"*verses"` I was working on, and wanted to come up with a way to generalize this style of loading packages all at once. It's nice to not have to type in the same set of packages over and over again!

The name and theme comes from the act of building ladders to scale a castle's fortifications. The ladders are thus handy helpers when it comes to tackling that big project (the castle) that requires all the libraries under the sun.
